// Abstraction:
// What it is: Abstraction is like simplifying complex things by hiding the unnecessary details. It allows you to focus on what's important and ignore the stuff you don't need to know about right now
// In JavaScript: For example, when you use a function, you don't need to know all the code inside it. You just use the function's name and input values, abstracting away the complex code inside


// Encapsulation:
// What it is: Encapsulation is like putting things in a box and only allowing specific ways to interact with them. It helps keep data and functionality organized and safe from unintended changes
// In JavaScript: You can use objects to encapsulate data and functions that work on that data. This way, you can control how data is accessed and modified


// Inheritance:
// What it is: Inheritance is like getting traits from your parents. It's a way to create new objects or classes based on existing ones, inheriting their characteristics
// In JavaScript: You can create new objects or classes that inherit properties and methods from existing ones. This is useful for reusing code and creating a hierarchy of objects


// Polymorphism:
// What it is: Polymorphism is like different shapes fitting into the same slot. It allows objects or functions to behave differently based on their specific type or context
// In JavaScript: You can have different objects or functions that share a common interface but perform different actions based on their individual implementations. This helps make your code more flexible and extensible
